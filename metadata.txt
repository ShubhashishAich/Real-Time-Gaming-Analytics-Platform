===============================================================================

Generalized Telemetry Data for Match-3 / Puzzle Games
1. Session Metadata

player_id

session_id

device_info (OS, app version, network type)

session_start, session_end

total_session_time

2. Level Progression

level_id

attempt_number (1st try, 2nd try, etc.)

level_start_time, level_end_time

level_outcome (win/lose)

score

stars_earned (1–3)

remaining_moves or remaining_time

3. Gameplay Events

moves_made (count per level)

special_items_created (color bomb, rocket, etc.)

boosters_used (type + count)

powerups_acquired (from rewards, gifts, etc.)

obstacles_cleared (jellies, blockers, etc.)

4. Economy / Monetization

coins_earned

coins_spent

boosters_purchased (currency type: soft/hard)

extra_moves_purchased (yes/no)

5. Engagement & Retention

daily_login_streak

ads_watched (count, type: rewarded / interstitial)

time_between_sessions

social_interactions (lives sent/received, leaderboard position)

✅ This generalized telemetry is enough to:

Track player progression (levels, retries, wins/losses).

Analyze engagement (session time, streaks, retries).

Monitor monetization behavior (booster use, purchases).

Feed ML models for churn prediction, difficulty balancing, and personalization.
